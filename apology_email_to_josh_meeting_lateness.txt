Subject: Apologies for being late to the meeting

Hi Josh,

I'm really sorry for being late to the meeting. There was an accident on the motorway, and I'm currently stuck in standstill traffic. I’ll join as soon as I can. If there are any urgent items, please feel free to share a quick summary and I’ll catch up on the rest when I join.

Thanks for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
